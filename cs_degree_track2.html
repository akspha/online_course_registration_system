			<h3>Objectives </h3>
				<p>
				The Graduate Program in Computer Science provides intensive preparation in the design, programming, theory, and applications of computers. The Department of Computer Science offers courses of study leading to the M.S. in Computer Science, the M.S. in Computer Science with Major in Software Engineering, Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, and the PhD degree in Software Engineering. Training is provided for both academically oriented students and students with professional goals in the many business, industrial or governmental occupations requiring advanced knowledge of computer theory and technology. Courses and research are offered in a variety of subfields of computer science, including operating systems, computer architecture, computer graphics, pattern recognition, automata theory, combinatorics, artificial intelligence, data & network security, natural language processing, database design, computer networks, programming languages, software systems, analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, software engineering, software testing, software reliability, scheduling, visualization, fault-tolerant computing, parallel processing, telecommunications networks, telecommunications software, performance of systems, VLSI, computational geometry, and design automation.

				A comprehensive program of evening courses is offered which enables part-time students to earn the master’s degree or to select individual courses of interest.
				</p>

			<h3>Facilities </h3>
				<p>
				The Department of Computer Science has a large number of PCs, Sun Workstations, and several servers for research use. Laboratories are available for parallel processing, distributed systems, software engineering, high-performance computing, graphics, programming languages and systems, telecommunications, CAD and graph visualization, image understanding and processing, artificial intelligence, data mining, natural language processing, speech processing, and web technologies. The Department of Computer Science has an Internet 2 connection and all major computers on campus are linked by an Ethernet network.

				In addition to the Computer Science faculty, there are individuals who are involved in computer related work in many other areas of the university, including the several physical and social sciences and in various areas of business and management. Students majoring in computer science with interest in these important application areas have the opportunity to consult and work with talented faculty from a wide range of disciplines. The department actively participates in a number of interdisciplinary degree programs which include MS and Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, MS and Ph.D. in Telecommunications Engineering, and Ph.D. in Geospatial Information Sciences.

			<h3> Degree Requirements </h3>

			<p>The University's general degree requirements are discussed on the <a href = "http://catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/policies/policy">Graduate Policies and Procedures page </a> ( <a href = "http://catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/policies/policy">catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/policies/policy </a>).
			The student may choose a thesis plan or a non-thesis plan. The thesis plan requires a minimum of 27 semester credit hours of courses, plus completion of an approved thesis (six thesis semester credit hours). This thesis is directed by a supervising professor and must be approved by the head of the Department of Computer Science. The non-thesis plan also requires a minimum of 33 semester credit hours of courses.
			By a judicious planning of courses chosen from the computer science curriculum, supervised and approved by the graduate advisor, students may pursue the MS degree in Computer Science while emphasizing specific areas of the discipline. Students may also choose to receive the MS degree in Software Engineering. Because of the rapidly changing nature of the computer science discipline, the specific courses required may change by the time of the student's admission. A listing of the required courses will be specified by the student's advisor. Specific degree requirements follow.</p>

			<p class = "AItrack"> Intelligent Systems Track </p>

			<ul>
				<li>CS 6320 Natural Language Processing</li>

				<li>CS 6363 Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</li>

				<li>CS 6364 Artificial Intelligence</li>

				<li>CS 6375 Machine Learning</li>

			</ul>

			Choose one course from the following two courses:
			<ul>
				<li> CS 6360 Database Design </li>

				<li> CS 6378 Advanced Operating Systems </li>
			</ul>


			<p class = "AItrack">Required Prerequisite Courses </p>
			<ul>
				<li >CS 5303 Computer Science I </li>

				<li>CS 5330 Computer Science II </li>

				<li>CS 5333 Discrete Structures </li>

				<li>CS 5343 Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures </li>

				<li>CS 5348 Operating Systems Concepts</li>
			</ul>

			<p class  = "AItrack">Electives (minimum of 18 hours)</p>
			<p>
				Five [15 credit hours] 6000/7000/8000 level elective CS courses, or six hours of thesis or project courses plus three elective courses [9 + 6 = 15 credit hours], with approval of a graduate adviser; a minimum grade point average of 3.0 is required. Courses that are prerequisites to the student’s core requirements are especially recommended. Approved electives must be taken to make a minimum of 33 hours.

				Note: For the information assurance track, students must also take six elective courses (three CS electives and three approved information assurance electives), and all electives must be 6000 level or above. A course cannot be used to satisfy both core and elective requirements.

				While the Department of Computer Science offers both the Master of Science in Computer Science and the Master of Science in Computer Science with Major in Software Engineering degrees, students are not permitted to pursue both degrees.
			</p>

			<h3> Admission Requirements </h3>
			<p>
				The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the <a href = "http://catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/admission">Graduate Admission page </a> (<a href = "http://catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/admission">catalog.utdallas.edu/2015/graduate/admission </a>).
				The student entering the Computer Science MS program should have an undergraduate preparation equivalent to a baccalaureate in a quantitative science, including calculus and linear algebra. However, special arrangements (requiring more than the minimal number of semester credit hours) can be made for students with good undergraduate preparation in other fields. Minimum requirements are:
				Bachelor's degree which includes 2 semesters of calculus and 1 semester of linear algebra.
				A GPA (grade point average) of at least 3.0 (last 60 semester credit hours). GPA in quantitative courses of at least 3.3.
				GRE revised scores of 308, 153, 155, and 4 for the combined, verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing components, respectively, are advisable based on our experience with student success in the program.
				Applicants are admitted on a competitive basis.
				Students lacking undergraduate preparation in computer science must complete the courses listed above.At the discretion of the graduate advisor, a diagnostic exam may be required.
